PostFetcherApp
This mini project demonstrates how to fetch data from an API using Axios and display it on a webpage. The project utilizes the Module Design Pattern for better code organization and maintainability.

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository or download the files.

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PostFetcherApp.git
cd PostFetcherApp
Ensure you have an internet connection to load Axios from the CDN.

Open index.html in your web browser.

The page will display a list of posts fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. If there is an error while fetching the data, an error message will be displayed.

Explanation of the Design Pattern
The project uses the Module Design Pattern:

Encapsulation: Keeps related code (data fetching and display logic) together, separated from the rest of the application.
Reusability: The module can be reused across different parts of the application or in different projects.
Maintainability: The code is easier to manage, test, and debug.
Separation of Concerns: Different functionalities (data fetching, data display, error handling) are divided into separate functions within the module, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
By using this pattern, the code is organized into a self-contained module (PostModule), which can be easily maintained and extended in the future.
